This is a python program utilizing k nearest neighbor algorithm to predict the income.
We are considering a binary classification problem where the goal is to classify whether a person has an annual income more or less than $5000 given census information. The data are split into two subsets, a training set with 8000 labelled rows in file named train.csv, and a test set with 2000 unlabelled rows in file named test_pub.csv. 
Below is a list of attributes available in the dataset.
attribute name | type | list of values
id: numerical. (Unique for each point. Don't use this as a feature)
age: numerical
workclass: categorical. Private, Self-emp-not-inc, Self-emp-inc, Federal-gov, Local-gov, State-gov, Without-pay
education-num: ordinal. 1.Preschool, 2.lst-4th, 3.5th-6th, 4.7th-8th, 5.9th, 6.10th, 7.11th, 8.12th, 9.HS-grad, 10.Some-college, 11.Assoc-voc, 12.Assoc-acdm, 13.Bachelors, 14.Masters, 15.Prof-school, 16.Doctorate
marital-status: categorical. Married-civ-spouse, Divorced, Never-married, Separated, Widowed, Married-spouse-absent, Married-AF-spouse
occupation: categorical. Tech-support, Craft-repair, Other-service, Sales, Exec-managerial, Prof-specialty, Handlers-cleaners, Machine-op-inspct, Adm-clerical, Farming-fishing, Transport-moving, Priv-house-serv, Protective-serv, Armed-Forces
relationship: categorical. Wife, Own-child, Husband, Not-in-family, Other-relative, Unmarried
race: categorical. White, Asian-Pac-Islander, Amer-Indian-Eskimo, Other, Black
sex: categorical. 0:Male, 1:Female
capital-gain: numerical.
capital-loss: numerical.
hours-per-week: numerical.
native-country: categorical. United-States, Cambodia, England, Puerto-Rico, Canada, Germany, Outlying-US(Guam-USVI-etc), India, Japan, Greece, South Korea, China, Cuba, Iran, Honduras, Philippines, Italy, Poland, Jamaica, Vietnam, Mexico, Portugal, Ireland, France, Dominican-Republic, Laos, Ecuador, Taiwan, Haiti, Columbia, Hungary, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Scotland, Thailand, Yugoslavia, El-Salvador, Trinada&Tobago, Peru, Hong, Holand-Netherlands
income: ordinal. 0: <= 50k , 1: > 50k (This is the class label. Don't use this as a feature.)

The dataset has three types of attributes - numerical, ordinal, and nominal. Numerical attributes represent continuous numbers. Ordinal attributes are a discrete set with a natural ordering, for instance different levels of education. Nominal attributes are also discrete set of possible values, however, there is no clear ordering between them. For nominal variables like workclass, marital-status, occupation, relationship, race, and native-country, we've transformed these into one column for each possible value with either a 0 or 1. 

The program will read two files named: train.csv, and test_pub.csv and generate an output file named: test_predicted.csv

Install the numpy package by using the below command
pip install numpy
Use the below command to run the program
python knn.py
